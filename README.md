My react pair-programming in selleo, app which check my skills:

The app is called "Districtr" 🗺️
It allows users to add districts with descriptions what's interesting in them. The created districts can be later listed and displayed one-by-one.

Unfortunately the client set a Deadline for 2hours, so you have to do your best to implement at least Basic features

🎯 Basic features 🎯
Create a Region form
Region form should have input for name, textfield for description and map for borders. Users should be able to define the borders by clicking on the map. Submitting the form should navigate to the regions list.

Display list of Region names
Names of all created regions should be displayed in the list.
